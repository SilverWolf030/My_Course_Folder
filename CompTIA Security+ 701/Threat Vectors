- Threat Vectors

  - Social engineering attacks:

    - Message-based attacks:

      - Email phishing
      - SMS or text message
      - Chat - Direct messages (DM) or instant messaging (IM)

    - Voice-based attacks:
      - Aka "vishing" or "voice phishing"
      - Method of talking an individual into doing something they normally would not do

  - File-based attacks:

    - Many forms of malware attack system through a downloaded file or email attachment
    - File-less malware is a form of attack where there is no file that stays resident on the system

      - Usually a "downloader" pulls the malware form online, runs the malware, does the damage and removes itself making it hard to identify or spot

    - Images can also be malicious:
      - Through use of steganography
      - Can contain malware hidden inside
      - Can contain sensitive information being exfiltrated

  - Vulnerable software:

    - Software can have a number of security flaws baked in:
      - inadvertent, oversights
      - Malicious inclusion, "backdoor"
    - To correct discovered vulnerabilities, we much watch for patches and update at necessary

  - Removable media:

    - Mass storage devices
    - Data can be exfiltrated from a organization through removable media
    - Malware can be introduced to an organization through removable media
    - 'Airgapped" systems can be compromised through removable media
      - Example: Stuxnet attack on iranian nuclear facility

  - Unsupported systems and applications:

    - Any system connected to an organization's network should be identified and monitored
    - Any software in use at an organization should be listed and watched for updates
    - If users are introducing other systems or software that are not receiving regular patches or update, this is a vulnerability
    - Two ways to scan for these:
      - Client-based scanning (agent-based)
        - Use of software agent on the endpoint systems to scan software and report back to central server
      - Agentless:
        - Use of a network service to scan for (enumerate) hosts and query software installed on those hosts

  - Insecure networks:

    - Wired:
      - Active network ports within facility, especially those in public or obscure areas (e.g., lobby, dinning facility, hallways, vacant offices)
    - Wireless
      - Lack of wireless security, use of insecure protocols
      - Transmitting beyond confines of the facility
    - Bluetooth:
      - Disable Bluetooth if not needed
      - Monitor connections via Bluetooth
      - Be aware that Bluetooth can be an attack vector

  - Open ports:

    - Any point where data can connect to an internal service is potential point of attack
    - Any open ports on a host or firewall is a potential vulnerability
    - All unnecessary, unneeded services should be disabled and their ports closed
    - Only required ports should be opened on a firewall
      - Data passing through these ports should be monitored and managed for malicious activity

  - Default credentials

    - admin : admin
    - Leaving the default settings on a system can open an organization up to widespread attacks. Numerous scanner exist that attempt to exploit default login information on commercially available devices.

  - Supply chain attacks:

    - Type of cyber-attack where an attacker goes for a less secure system within supply chain
    - Rather than attacking a company directly, attackers may realize the target information may be in a less protected system elsewhere in the supply chain.
    - Supply chain consists of:
      - Managed Service Providers (MSP)
      - Vendors
      - Suppliers
