- Password Attacks:

  - Brute force:

    - Attempting to guess a password by trying each combination and permutation.

  - Dictionary attacks:

    - Trying a list of many possible passwords to guess the password for one account
    - Dictionary lists are publicly available online, some are enormous in size reaching over 1TB.
    - Each compromised system can yield more possible passwords that get thrown onto the heap of known passwords making up dictionary lists.

  - Password Spraying:
    - Trying one "known-goog" password across many accounts
    - Less likely to trigger account lockouts or failed password timeouts.

- Cryptographic attacks:

  - Birthday Attack:

    - A birthday attack is a subset of a collision attack. A collision attack is simply when a process is found that can produce the same value. These are associated with cryptographic hashing.

  - Collision Attack:

    - An attack that exploits weak cryptographic hash functions. It works by finding separate input values that produce the same hashed value.

  - Known plaintext attack:

    - When an attacker has access to both the plaintext and ciphertext of an encryption method.
    - The attacker can use this to look for weaknesses in the encryption method and easily decipher future encrypted messages.

  - Known ciphertext attack:

    - The attacker known the ciphertext bus has no access to the plaintext. This can make finding weaknesses more difficult.

  - Rainbow tables:

    - A table of previously-computed values for reversing hashing functions
    - Used to crack hashed passwords.
