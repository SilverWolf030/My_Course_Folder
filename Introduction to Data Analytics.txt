Introduction to Data Analytics:
- A modern day Data Ecosystem includes a network of interconnected and continually evolving entities that includes:
        - Data that is available in a host of different formats, structures, and sources.
        - Enterprise Data Enviroments: in which raw data is staged so it can be organized, 
            cleaned, and optimized for use by end-users.
        - End-users such as Busness Stakeholder, Analyzers, and Programmers who consume data for various purposes.

- Key Players in the Data Ecosystem:
    - Data Engineers: Data Architectures, Busness Operations, and Anaysis.
        - Work within the data ecosystem to, Extract, Intergrate, and Organize data from disperate sources.
        - Clean, Transform, and prepare data.
        - Design, Store, and Manage data indata repositories.
        - They enabled data to be accesible in formats and systems that the various business apllications, 
            as well as stakeholder like data analysis and data scientists can utilize.
        - Requires Good knowledge at programing, Sound knowledge of systems and technology archetectures, and in depth
            understanding of relational data bases and non-relational data stores. 
    - Data Analyst: Translates data and numbers into plain language so organizations can make decisions.
        - Inspect and clean data for driving insights.
        - Identify coralations, find patterns, apply statistical methods to Analytics, Mine data, and visualize data to interpret
            and present the findings of data analysis.
        - Requires good knowledge of spreadsheets, writing queries and using statistical tools to create charts and dashboards.
        - Programing skills, strong analytical and story telling skills.
    - Data Scientist: Analyse data for actionable insights.
        - Create predictive models using machine learing and deep learning that train on past data
            to create predictive models.
        - Requires knowledge of mathmatics and statistics.
        - Understading of programming languages and building data models.
        - Domain knowledge
    - Business Analytics:
        - Leverage the work of data analyst and data scientists to look at possible implications for their business
            and the actions they need to take or recommed.

        - Organize and monitor data on different business functions.
        - Explore data to extract insight and acttions that improve business performace.

- What is Data Analyse?
    - Gathering, cleaning, analysing, and mining data
    - Interpreting results
    - Reporting findings
    - We find patterns within data and coralations between differnet data paints.
    - Thru this insights are generated and conclusions are drawn.
    - Data Analysis helps business Understand past performances and informs decison making that 
        validate our course of actions before commiting to it.

- Differnt types of Data Analysis:
    - Descriptive Analytics: 
        - Helps answer questions about what happenied for a given period of theme by summerizing
            past data and presenting finding to stakeholders.
        - Helps provide insight into past events.
    - Diagnostic Analytics: 
        - Helps answer the question, Why did it happen?
        - Takes the insights from descriptive analysing to dig deeper to find the cause of the outcome.
    - Predictive Analytics:
        - Helps answer the question, What will happen next?
        - Leverages historical data and trends to predict future outcomes.
    - Prescriptive Analytics:
        - Helps answer the question, What should be dont about it?
        - By analyzing past decisoins and events the likelihood of different outcomes is estimated on the
            bases of which course of action is decided

- Keysteps in any Data Analysis Process:
    - Understanding the problem and desired resault.
    - Setting a clear metric:  Deciding what will be measured.
    - Gathering data soureces end tools
    - Cleaning data:  Fixing quality issues with data that could effect the accuracy of the data.
    - Analyzing and Mining data: Extracting and analyxing the data from differnet perspectives.
    - Interpreting resaults: Evaluate if your analysis is defendable againts objection, or any limitaions
        or circumstances may not hold true.
    - Presenting your findings: Communicate finding in clear, impactful, and convincing ways.

- Skills To Master:
    - Python
    - SQL
    - R
    - Tableau
    - Power BI 

- The role of a Data Analyst spans across:
    -Acquiring data that best serves the use case.
    -Preparing and analyzing data to understand what it represents.
    -Interpreting and effectively communicating the message to stakeholders who need to act on the findings.
    -Ensuring that the process is documented for future reference and repeatability.  

- In order to play this role successfully, Data Analysts need a mix of technical, functional, and soft skills.  
    -Technical Skills include varying levels of proficiency in using spreadsheets, statistical tools, visualization tools, 
        programming and querying languages, and the ability to work with different types of data repositories and big data platforms.
    -An understanding of Statistics, Analytical techniques, problem-solving, the ability to probe a situation from 
        multiple perspectives, data visualization, and project management skills â€“ all of which come under Functional Skills 
        a Data Analyst needs in order to play an effective role.
    - Soft Skills include the ability to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, tell a compelling story with data, 
        and garner support and buy-in from stakeholders. Curiosity to explore different pathways and intuition that helps to give a 
        sense of the future based on past experiences are also essential skills for being a good Data Analyst.
