- Technical Foundations of Generative AI
    - (GANs)
        - Involve two neutal networks, the generator and the discriminator, 
            working in tandem to profuce hightly realistic outputs.
                - [Latent Space] -> Noise -> Generator -> Fake Sample
                - Real Samples -> Discriminator -> Real
    
     Transformer Models (GPT and BERT)
        - Use Attention mehanisms to create text that is contextually relevant 
            and stylistically coherent.
        - Focus Selectively
        - Highlight Information
        - Coherent 
        - Contextually Appropriate
    
- Human design choices, Engineering and Oversight
    [Training Data] -> [Machine Learning] -> [Model + Inputs: Producton data/Information] 
        -> [Processing] -> {Continuous Learning -> Machine Learning} ->
        Outputs: Predictions, Actions, Recommendations, and Decisions.
