- Technical Foundations of Generative AI
    - (GANs)
        - Involve two neutal networks, the generator and the discriminator, 
            working in tandem to profuce hightly realistic outputs.
                - [Latent Space] -> Noise -> Generator -> Fake Sample
                - Real Samples -> Discriminator -> Real
    
     Transformer Models (GPT and BERT)
        - Use Attention mehanisms to create text that is contextually relevant 
            and stylistically coherent.
        - Focus Selectively
        - Highlight Information
        - Coherent 
        - Contextually Appropriate

    [Training Data] -> [Machine Learning] -> [Model + Inputs: Producton data/Information] 
        -> [Processing] -> {Continuous Learning -> Machine Learning} ->
        Outputs: Predictions, Actions, Recommendations, and Decisions.
    
- Artificial Intelligence 
    - AI is the field of computing focued on creating systems capbable of performing tasks
        that wold typically require human intetlligence.These tasks include reasoning, learning,
        problem-solving, perception, langueage understanding, and even the ability to move 
        and manipulate objects.
    - AI technologies leverage algorithms and dynamic computing enviroments to enable machines to solve
        complex problems, adapt to new situations, and learn from past experiences.
    - Central to AI is Maching Learning (ML), where algorithms detect patterns and infer
        probabilities from data, allowing the machine to improve its performance over time.
    - AT systems can range from simple, rule-based algorithms to complex neural networks modeled on 
        the human brain.

- Machine Learning (ML) s
    - (ML) is a critical domain within artifical inteligence that emphasized the development of
        algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without
        explicit instructions. 
    - Instead, these systems learn and make predictions or decisions based on data.

    - Types of learning:
        - Supervised Learning:
            - Algorithms learn from labeled training data, aiming predict outcomes for
                new inputs.
        - Unsupervised Learning:   
            - Algrothms identify patterns in data without needing labeled responces,
                often used for clustering and association.
        - Reinforcedment Learning: 
            - Models learn to make sequences fo decisions by reveiving feedback on the 
                actions' effectieness.

    - Algorithms and Techniques:
        - Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
        - Advaned techniques involve deep learning, which uses layered neural networks to
            analyze various levels of data features.

    - Data hangling and Processing:
        - Effective machine learning requires robust data preprocessing including normalization,
            handling missing values, and feature selection to improve model accuracy.

    - Performance evaluation:
        - ML models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and 
            the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, ensuring that they 
            perfrom well on unseen data.

    - Application Areas:
        - ML is applied in various fields such as finace for algorithmic trading, healthcare 
            for redictive diagnostics, and autonomous vehicls for navigation systems.
