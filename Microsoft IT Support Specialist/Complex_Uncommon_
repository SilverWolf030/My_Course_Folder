- Gather and analyze diagnostic data:

  - Collect logs from all relevant system components like servers, databases, and network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls.

  - Review performance metrics to identify patterns or anomalies that coincide with performance issues.

  - Use monitoring tools to create a timeline of events leading up to the performance degradation.

  - Document any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity found in the logs.

- Identify potential causes:

  - Cross-reference the collected data with the system's documentation to understand normal versus abnormal behavior.

  - Based on the diagnostic data, create a list of potential causes, such as hardware failures, software bugs, of network issues.

  - Prioritize the list based on the likelihood and potential impact of each cause.

  - Develop a hypothesis for the most probable cause of the issues.

- Isolate and test hypotheses:

  - Use system documentation to identify safe methods for isolation each potential causes without disrupting critical operations.

  - Test the highest-priority hypothesis first by isolation the suspected component and observing the system's performance.

  - If the hypothesis is disproven, move on to the next potential cause and repeat the testing process.

- Implement a solution:

  - Once
