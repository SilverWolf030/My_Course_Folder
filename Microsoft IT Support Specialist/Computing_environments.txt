- Preventing a attacker from gaining entry to a system:
  - Gateway security is the top recommendation for cybersecurtiy. The reason is simple: if you can prevent any external unauthorzed entity from accessing your system, you can ensure that your assets are procteced. As with personal computers, the devices for accomplishing this are known as firewalls. A firewall will sit between a trusted network and filter traffic coming from an untrusted one.
  - With on-premisis access, implementing a firewall is relatively straightforward; all traffic coming from the internet is outside traffic and is treated with severe restrictions. All inside traffic is authorized and subject to more relaxed contraints. This is somewhat more complicated for cloud-based businesses, as the resources accessing the cloud resources may be dispersed. This means that it is more difficult to ameka clear distincition between the inside and outside of a network.
- Segregation to limit damage upon access
  - If a threat is able to breach a gateway, there is another safeguard that can be implemented:
  - Segregation access is an effective security measure that can be applied to both traditional and cloud-based businesses. There are several ways that this can be achieved, the shared idea is that access to one area only gives you a pass to some parts of a business, not all of it. These cloud-based solutions are implemented to deal with the vulnerabilities created by people accessing company resources using different types of devices in different and changing locations.
  - Zero Standing Access is the overarching concept that access to the production environment must be kept to a minimum and cannot be persisted over time. This means you must validate that you are authroized whenever you wish to access production-related areas. Even then, your access will only allow you to make changes sufficient to the area you have been authorized to access. Two critical policies that have grown from this are:
    - Just-In-Time (JIT)
    - Just-Enough-Access(JEA)
      - JIT means that having accessed a given area;you will only retain your access for a limited period of time before you are automatically ejected or asked to re-enter some authorization code.
      - JEA relates to the limitations on the changes you can make while there.
      - As a security specialist configures which areas should be accessed by which individuals, as well as what privileges are required when a specialized task needs to be engaged very carefullu. Giving the wrong individual inappropriate access can be the difference between a minor and a severe security breach.
  
  - Recovery:
    - In this regard, cloud-based businesses have an advantage over traditional ones because creating back-ups and spinning up new environments is part of cloud computing.
    - In a traditional approach, applications are run on hardware, and it is advised to save and back up information regularly, Recall that this can be done by following the 3-2-1 recovery plan, which involves keeping three copies of everything in 2 formats, and 1 copy off-site.
    - In operating on the cloud, cloud-based businesses already have their workflow virtualized. In addtion, the underlying architecture ensures that backups are created of everything that goes online. This ensures that if there is a issue with accessing a business's resources, the hosting company can provide an alternative. Finally, it is good practive employed by cloud providers to store information in different geoplogical locations.

- Hybrid Cloud Computing:
  - A hybid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premisis infrastructure-- or a private cloud-- with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments.
  - Many organizaions choose a hydrid cloud approach due to business imperatives such as meeting regulartory and data sovereignty requirements, taking full advantage of on-premisis technology investment, or addressing low loatency issues.
  - The hybrid cloud is evolving to enclude edge workloads as well. Edge computing brings the computing power of the cloud to IoT deviecs -- closer to where the data resides. By moving workloads to the edge, devices spend less time communicating with the cloud, reducing latency, and they are even able to operate reliably in exted offline periods.

- The benefits of hybrid cloud platform:
  - A hybrid cloud platform gives organizaions many advatages-- such as greater flexabiltiy, more deployment options, security, compliance, and getting more value from their existing infrastructure. When computing and proccessing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computin gives businesses the abiltiy to seamlessly scale up their on-premises infrastructure to the public cloud to handle any overflow--without giving third-party dataceters access to the entirety of their data. Organizarions gain the flexibilty and innovation the public cloud provides by running certain workloads in the cloud while keeping highly sensitive data in their own datacenter to meet client needs or regulatory requirements.
  - This not only allows companies to scale computin gresources-- it also eliminates the need to make massive capittal expenditures to handle short-term spikes in demand, as well as when the busniss needs to free up local resources form more senditive data or applications. Comanies will pay only for resources they temporatily use instead of having to purchase, program, and maintain additional resources and equipment that could remain idle over long periods of time.
  - Advantages of the hyrid cloud:
    - Control: Your organizrion can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets or workloads that require low latency.
    - flexabiltiy: You can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.
    - Cost-effectiveness: With the abilty to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.
    - Ease: Transitioning to the cloud doesn't have to be overwhleming because you can migrate gradually--phasing in workloads over time.

  - Understaning your deployment options-Public cloud, Private cloud, or Hybrid cloud:
    - There's no one type of lcoud computing that's right for everyone, Several different cloud computing models, types, and services have evolved to meet the rapidly changi technology needs of organizations.
  
  - What is Public cloud:
    - Public clouds are the most common type of cloud computing deployment. The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the lcoud provider. Microsof tAzure is an example of a public cloud.
    - In a public cloud, you share the same hardware, storage, and network devices with other organizations or cloud "tenants," and you access services and manage your account using a web brouser. Public cloud deployments are frequently used to provide web-based email, onlinve office applications, storage, and testing and development environments.
      - Advantages of a public cloud:
        - Lower costs: No need to purchase hardware or software, and you pay only for the service you use.
        - No Maintenance: Your service provider provides the maintenance.
        - Near-unlimited scalability: On-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.
        - High Reliablity: A vast network of servers ensure agianst failure.

  - What is Private cloud:
    - A private cloud consists of cloud computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in a private cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your organization.
    - In this way, a private cloud can make it easier for an organization to customize its resources to meet specific IT requirements. Private clouds are often used by government agencies, financial institutions, any other mid- to large-size oragnizaitons with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment.
      - Advantages of a private cloud:
        - More flexibility: Your organization can customize its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.
        - More Control: Resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and privacy are possible.
        - More scalability: Private clouds often offer more scalabitly compared to on-permises infrastructure in the.
    
  - Mitigateing threats by using Windows 10 security features:
    - Windows Defender SmartScreen: Can check the reputation of a downloaded application by using a service that Microsoft maintains. The first time a user runs an app that originates from the internet (even if the user copied it from another PC), SmartScreen checks to see if the app lacks a reputation or is known to be malicious, and responds accordilngly.
    - Credential Guard: Uses virtualization-based security to isolate secreets, such as NTLM password hashes and Kerberos Ticket Granting Tekcets, so that only privileged system software can access them.
    - Enterprise Certificate pinning: Enables you to protect your internal domain names from chaining to unwanted certificates or to fraudulently issued certain certificates. With enterprise certficate pinning, you can "pin" (associate) an X.509 certificate and its public key to its Certification Authority.
    - Device Guard: Includes a Code intergrity policy that you create; an allowlist of trusted apps-the only apps allowed to run in your organization.Device Guard also includes a powerful system mitigation called hypervisor-protected code intergrity (HVCI), which uses virtualization-based security (VBS) to protect Windows'kernal-mode code integrity vallidation process. HVCI has specific hardware requirements, and works with Code Integrity policies to help stop atacks even if they gain access to the kernal. Device Guard is included in Win 10 Enterprise and Win Server 2016
    - Microsfot Defender Antivirus: A robust inbox anti-malware solution, which helps keep devices free of viruses and other malware.
    - Memory Proctection: Helps to proctect against memory-based attacks, where malware or other code manipulation memory to gain control of a system (for example, malware that attempts to use buffer overruns to inject malicious executable code into memory). Note: a subset of apps won't be able to run if some of these mitigations are set to their most restrictive sttings. Testing can help you maximize proctectionwhile still allowing these apps to run.
    - Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) Designed to enable the anti-malware solution to start before all non-Microsoft drivers and apps. If malware modifies a boot-related driver. ELAM will detect the change, and Windows will prevent the driver from starting, thus blocking driver-based rootkits.
    - Device Health Attestation: (DHA) provides a way to confirm that devices attempting to connect to an orgaization's network are in a healthy state, not compromised with malware. When SHA has been configured, a device's actual boot data measurements can be checked agiant the expected "healthy" boot data. If the ckeck indicates a device is unhealthy, the device can be prevented from accessing the network.

    - Configuralbe Windows 10 mitigations designed to help proctect against memory manipulation require in-depth understanding of these threats and mitigations and knowledge about how the operating system and applications handle memory. The standard process for maximizing these types of mitigations is to work in a test lab to discover whether a given setting interferes with any applications tha you use so that you can deploy setting that maximize protections while still sllowing apps to run correctly.
    
    -  As an IT professional, you can ask application developers and software vendors to deliver applications that include an extra proctection called Control Flow Guard (CFG). No configuration is needed in the operating system- the proctection is compiled into applicatons.
