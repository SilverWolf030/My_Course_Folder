- What is a log file?:

  - Log files are records of event committed to a file in a list format. They can include all sorts of information about events that happened at a particular time. Every device on the network creates log files, thus giving you a history of what's been happening.

  - Logs typically contain five headed-up areas. They are:

    - Timestamp - the time of the event
    - Log Level - how severe or important the event is.
    - Username - who caused the event.
    - Service or Application - what caused the event.
    - Event Description - what has happened.

  - This information is useful, especially because it's timestamped. If you were troubleshooting a problem, you could check the logs of a particular device to see what was going on at the time of the issue. Log files can be huge and store a lot of information, so you need to know what you are looking for. Thus the importance of the timestamp is a critical part of any log.

- Log File Types:

  - Event log - records information about the usage of network traffic and tracks login attempts, application events, and failed password attempts.

  - System Log (or syslog) - records operating system events, including startup messages, system changes, shutdowns, and errors, and warnings.

  - Server Log - contains a record of activities in a text document related to a specific server over a specific period of time.

  - Change Log - lists changes made to an application or file.

  - Availability Log - tracks uptime, availability, and system performance.

  - Authorization and Access Log - lists who is accessing application or files.

  - Resource Log - provides information on connectivity issues and any capacity problems.

  - Logs can be stored in many different formats. Applications like the Windows Event Viewer allows for easier troubleshooting and viewing of different events. But not all devices on a network have a graphical application like the event viewer on a Windows PC.

- Log File Filtering:

  - Filtering and searching through log files can be tedious and time-consuming, so it's good to know that the process can be sped up.

  - The easiest is to have a tool that can capture, display, and even analyze logs for you. Like, for example, Windows Azure Monitor, which you can use in the cloud to track what is happening.

  - The next option would be to use a search function within an application like Notepad in Windows.

  - Lastly, you can use search and filter commands. Different operating systems will allow you to search log files using certain commands. For example, the command grep is a great command as it is supported across many Linux systems and will allow you to search for patterns withing log files. If you're searching for a particular error or IP address, this can be very powerful command. Using such a command requires practice for you to really benefit from the advanced search capabilities and filtering they can provide.
