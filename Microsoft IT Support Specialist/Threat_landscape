  - Breaking Down Modern Cybercrime:

    - Trojan Attacks:

      - This is a umbrella term that covers several attack types, including:

        - Exploit Trojans
        - Downloader Trojans
        - Ransom Trojans
        - Backdoor Trojans

      - While trojans wil behave differently depending on the type, the common trait of this approach is
        that a user inadvertently introduces malicious code into the organization and triggers it behind
        the defensive walls. The best defense against trojan attacks is to practice vigilant internet usage.
        Some guidelines are to never click on an unsolicited email with unexpected attachments, and always
        examine domain names and links before clicking on them. Be particularly vigilant with misspellings,
        such as zeroes that have been misspelled with O's, a trick used to lure an unwary user into bringing the
        horse behind the gate.

    - Ransomware attacks:

      - The secoond most common type of attack from the previous data is ransomware. Recall that ransomware is an
        approach to cybercrime that is designed to cause disruption to sercives. This approach is featrued frequently in the news due to the scope of impact. It is not uncommon for these attacks to occur on a national scale, with infrastructure and vital services being the target. Recent Examples:

        - Ireland's Health Service's Executive (HSE) in 2021
        - Critical Ukraine Infrastructure in 2022
        - Costa Rica, which declared a state of emergency when 30 institutions of government were held to ransom

      - The methodology behind these types of attacks is to gain access to a system and lock out the legitimate owners
        untill a demand has been met. One approach to best mitigate against this type of attack is to ensure that no external actors gain accesss to your system. Best practices for achieving this unclude:
        - Use strong passwords, A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and typically woudl include a mix
          of characters, numbers, and symbols.
        - Keep your system up-to-date with the latest security pathces.
        - Ensure that only people with authorixation for a system can use its systems.

    - Botnet Attakcs:
      - A bot can be defined as an online software program that performs automated and repetitive tasks. They are a
        means of creating a Denial of Service to an organization. If a trojan attack is a subtle attempt to circumnavigate an application's defenses, a bot attack could be described as a full scalling of the walls.
      - These attacks are orchestrated so that a system is plagued with innumerable requests for information and
        services. These requests can come from any capable devices on the Internet of Things (IoT) that have an IP address.
      - This type of attack can be coupled with the trojan attack, when some of the code maliciously embedded in a
        system in used to make the request of another system. In this way, an attacker makes use of someone else's digital resources to negate the resources of a targeted victim. One defensive approach to mitigate against these types of attacks is to monitor network traggic for suspicious activity. If a particular source is identified as making repeated calls that impact the operations of a system, then this address can be blocked. However, more sophisticated approaches must be emplyed when a variety of compromised systems are used.

- Explain Malware:

  - A software that attackers design to harm computer systems. Malware can do many things, fro causing damage to the
    computer, to allowing unauthorixed parties remote access to the computer, to collection and tranmitting sensitive information to unauthorised thrird parties. There are several, including: - Computer Viruses: This type of malware replicates by inserting a copy of its executable code into other
    applications, operating- system files, data files, or hardware components, such as the BIOS or boot sector files. - Computer Worms: Worms are a special form of malware that replicate without direct intervention. Worms spread
    across networks and can infect other computers on a network, without requiring a user to open an email attachment or file. - Trojan Horses: This type of malware provides an attacker remote access to the infected computer. - Ransomware" This type fo amlware encrypts user data, and you can recover your data only if you pay a ransom to
    the malware authors. - Spyware: This type of malware tracks how a computer is used without the user's consent.

  - Determine possible mitigations for malware threats.

    - Ensure that you apply all software and operating system updates to your deviices>
    - Ensure that you install and activate anti-malware software on your deviices.
    - Ensure that anti-malware definitions are current.
    - Avoid risky behavior, such as consuming pirated software or media.
    - Avoid opening suspicious email attachments, even if they are from senders you trust.

  - Understanding Phishing Scams:

    - Phishing is a type of online indentity theft. It uses email, phone calls, texts, and fraudulent websites that are
      designed to steal your personal data or information such as credit card numbers, passwords, account data, or other information.

    - Mitigating Phishing Threats:

      - Some of the tricks cybercriminals use:

        - Fakes Websites: If you receive a suspicious email message and it prompts you to select on a link, hover over
          the link. If the link does not match the name in your email, you could have received a phishing email, If you link points to a website or compnay you've never heard of or visited before, this could be a phishing attempt.

        - Threats: Emails that threaten account closure could be from a cypercriminal. If you reveive an email that urges
          you to take action by threatening that your account will be closed, be careful. Cybercriminals use a variety of techniques to steal your information and gain access to your data through threats and mis-information.

        - Spoofing companies or people you know: Scam artists use graphics in emial that appear to be connected to
          legitimate websites but actually take you to phony scam sites or legitimate-looking pop-up windows. Spoofing also can occur when a scammer imitates someone you know by mimicking thier email address. Always check that the address you're replying to is the correct one.

      - How to tell if an email is legitimate:
        - Hover over links to uncover the URL. Always check a url before you click on the link - Sometimes bad links
          are embedded into an email as a way to trick the reader.
        - Check for poor grammar and spelling errors. Companies rarely send out messages without proofreading content,
          so multiple spelling and grammar mistakes can signal a scam message.
        - Look for company contact information and brand accuracy. Most companies will have a brand identity that is
          recognizable in their emails. Look for logos, brand colors, and contact infromation in the message.

  - Explain common network-related security threats:

    - Eavesdropping: Also known as network sniffing, occurs when a hacker captures network packets that workstations
      connected to your network send and receive. Eavesdropping attacks can compromise your organization's sensitive data, such as passwords, which can lead to other, more damaging attacks.

    - Denial of Service (DoS) attack: This type of attack limits the function of a nerwork apps, or renders an app
      or network resource unavailable. Hackers can initiate a DoS attack in several ways, and often are aware of vulnerabilities in the target app that they can exploit to render it unavailable. Hackers typically perform a DoS attackby overloading a service that replies to network requests, such as Domain Name Systems (DNS), with a large number of fake requests in an attempt to overload and shut down a service or the server that hosts the service. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a version of a DoS attack.

    - Port Scanning: Apps that run on a computer using the TCP/IP protocol use Transmission Control Protocal (TCP)
      or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) parts to identify themselves. One way that attackers exploit a network is to query hosts for open ports on which they listen for client requests. Once attackers identify an open port, they can use othere attack techniques to access the services that are running on the computer.

    - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: The network attacker uses a computer to impersonate a legitimate host on the
      network with which your computers are communicating. The attacker intercepts all of the communications that are inteded for a destination host. The attackers might wish to view the data in transit between the two hosts, but also can modify that data before forwarding the packets to the destination host.
