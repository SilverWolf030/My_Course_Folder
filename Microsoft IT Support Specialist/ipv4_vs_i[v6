- A new IP version:

  - Several solutions were introduced to mitigate the threat of running out of IPv4 addresses. These solutions have kept IPv4 functional over the years, but ultimately the world has run out of new IPv4 addresses to hand out.

  - A new IP version was needed to address this exhaustion, and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) was introduced as a the new IP standard. The Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) designed and developed IPv6 in 1998, and it was finally adopted as a recognized internet standard in July 2017.

  - IPv6 uses a 128-bit address in comparison to the 32-bit address of IPv4. That is a significant increase in available addresses because for every additional bit, the possibilities double. For instance, IPv4 has over 4 billion addresses. If you were to add just 1 bit more to make it a 33-bit address, the possibilities double to 8 billion. That's a lot of addresses! in fact, IPv6 has approximately 7.9x10^28 times more addresses thank IPv4.

  - Although IPv6 has been around for some time, the transition to this new standard has been slow and will take time. This is because IPv4 and IPv6 aren't interoperable. In other words, they can't exchange and use information.

  - The structure of IPv6 is different from IPv4. Instead of four decimal numbers, for example, 192.168.1.1, it uses eight groups of four hexadecimal numbers called a hexadecet. And a colon separates each hexadecet.

    - A full IPv6 address looks like:
      - 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

  - IPv6 addresses use hexadecimals to represent this very large address space. Using hexadecimal takes the 128 bits in and address down to 32 digital numbers and letters.

  - IPv6 allows simplification with:

    - You can remove on or more leading zeros from any group. So 0042 can become 42.

    - You can replace consecutive sections of zeros with a double colon (::), but this can only be used once in an address.

      - Shortened version of the IPv6 example:

        - 2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334

    - Notice that all the instances of 0000 are removed. However, in many cases, the addresses can still be very long and more complicated than IPv4, which adds to the slow transition to IPv6

- IPv6 key functions:

  - IPv6 has numerous functions and addresses many of IPv4's problems, not just the limited address space. For instance, IPv4 can get really congested and slow itself down. IPv6 has a few features that address this issue. Own of which is to prevent broadcast traffic from running around a network.

  - IPv4 uses broadcast traffic to find devices on a network that no one has communicated with yet. This is similar to shouting out someone's ame in a packed hall. The trouble is that all other devices have to listen to the broadcast traffic, which slows them down. IPv6 doesn't have this type of traffic function, so there is no annoying shouting across the hall.

  - Instead, IPv6 uses multicast traffic. Multicast traffic is not a new concept, and IPv4 uses it too but to a limited extent because of the small address space. It works like this: A device only listens to a multicast traffic if it has subscribed to that service, and the rest of the devices can ignore it. It's very much like tuning into a radio signal you want to listen to, but you can switch it off again when you are no longer interested. The larger address space in IPv6 allows applications to communicate with different multicast addresses without disturbing others, thus making the network more efficient.

  - On the other hand, both IPv4 and IPv6 use unicast when they know the destination addresses: therefore, there is no need to shout out or tune in.

  - The last type of trafficking in anycast, and only IPv6 supports it. Anycast is an address that can be assigned to multiple devices worldwide. In this way, several servers with the same address can provide the same service to a network. The clever part here is that IPv6 will deliver a request to the nearest server that provides that service, in turn providing load-balancing functionality. Load balancing is just like various cashiers in a shop who balance a load of customers by letting them join the shortest available queue. Anycast does exactly the same across a network service.

  - In summary, IPv6 is a more efficient protocol because it does not use broadcast traffic on networks, which takes away a lot of the congestion in a IPv4 network.
