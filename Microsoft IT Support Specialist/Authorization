- Authentication Versus Authorization:

  - The main difference between authentication and authorization is that authentication verifies the identity of a user, while authorization determines what resources and services they are allowed to access. In other words, authentication is the process of proving who you are, while authorization is the process of determining what you are allowed to do.

  - Authentication is typically the first step in the access control process, as it ensures that only authorized users are granted access to the system. Once a user is authenticated, authorization mechanisms are used to determine what resources and service those users will be allowed to access.

    - Authentication:

      - Verifies the identity of a user, device, or system
      - Prevents access if not verified
      - First line of defense
      - Typically, a one-time event
      - Relies on user-provided credentials

    - Authorization:

      - Determines what actions a user can perform
      - Controls access to resources
      - Second line of defense
      - Ongoing process
      - Relies on predefined policies and rules

- Authorization is an ongoing process:

  - This all means that authorization is not a one-time process. It requires continuous monitoring and updating. As the needs of the organization and its users change over time, access control policies should be reviewed and updated to ensure they remain effective and relevant.

  - Changes in regulations or industry standards may also require updates to access control policies to ensure compliance.

  - This ongoing authorization process can also involve monitoring user activity to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious behavior. Monitoring also positions organizations to detect and respond to potential security best practices. If users understand their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment, it can help prevent security incident.

  - In short, authorization is not a one-time event but rather a continuous process that requires ongoing attention and effort to ensure the security of the organization's resources and services.

- Authorization Models:

  - There are several different authorization models used in modern organizations, businesses, and computing. These models vary in their approach to controlling access to resource and services and are designed to meet the specific needs of different environments.

  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): is a model that assigns permission and privileges to users based on their predefined roles within an organization. this model is designed to simplify the management of large-scale systems by reducing the need for individual user-level permissions. This is the most common access control model that is widely adopted. Using RBAC, you can easily form a group of individuals, assign them to a role and then grant or deny permissions based on this role. The RBAC authorization model is so popular because it is time and cost-effective.

  - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):is like RBAC but considers attributes such as user roles, geographical locations, environment conditions and other contextual information when making access control decisions. This model provides fine-gained access control and enables organizations to implement complex access policies based on multiple criteria.

  - Mandatory Access Control (MAC): is a model that enforces access control based on predefined security policies. In the model, access to resources is controlled by a central authority rather than by individual users or resources owners. The central authority decides who can access a resource based on their security clearance level. This model is commonly used in government agencies, military organizations, and other high-security environments.

  - Discretionary Access Control (DAC): is a model in which users have the discretion to control access to resource they own. In this model, the owner of the resource decides who can access the resources and what extent. For example, in a shared folder, the owner can restrict access to specific files or folders, DAC is easy to implement, but it can lead to security issues if the owner does not manage access properly.

  - Rule-Based Access Control (RuBAC): is a fairly new access control model that incorporates the best of RBAC and ABAC and allows for greater flexibility in access control. In this model, access to resources and services is determined by a set of rules. These rules can be based on a combination of factors, such as "users with role A can access this resource between 9am and 5pm, while users with role b can access it between 5pm and 9am" and so on.

  - Federation: is a model for controlling acces to resources and services across multiple organizations or domains. It enables secure collaboration between oragnizations while maintaining contorl over access to resources. The great advantage of Federation is that it allows user to access resources and services of other organizations without requiring separate authentication for each organization.

  - In a Federation model, each organization maintains its own identity and across management system. These systems are then interconnected using a federation protocol, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenID Connect. When a user from one organization attempts to access a resource of another organization, the federation protocol is used to authenticate the user and determine their level of access.
