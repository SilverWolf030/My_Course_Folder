- Intro To Computing Devices:

  - What is a Driver?

    - A Driver is a software component that lets the operating system and a device communicate. For example,
      when an app needs to read data from a device, it calls a function implemented by the operating system.
      The operating system then calls a function implemented by the driver. The Driver, usually devoloped by
      the device's manufacturer, knows how to communicate with the device hardware to get the data. Once the
      driver get the data, it gives it back to the operating system. which then gives it back to the app.

          {Application} <--> {Windows Operating System} <--> {Driver} <--> {Device}

  - Expanding The Definition:

    - Drivers don't always have to be developed by the device's manufacturer. If a device follows a published hardware standard, Microsoft can write the driver, so the device designer doesn't have to provide one.

    - Not all drivers communicate directly witha device. Often, several drivers layered in a driver stack
      take part in an I/O request. The conventional way to visualize the stack is with the first participant at
      the top and the last participant at the bottom, as shown in this diagram. Some drivers in the stack change the request from one format to another. These drivers don't communicate directly with the device. Instead, they chage the request and pass it to drivers that are lower in the stack.

    {Application} <--> {Windows Operating System} <--> {Driver1 Filter Driver} <--> {Driver2 Filter Driver} <--> {Driver3 function driver} <--> {Device}

    - Function Driver: The driver that communicates directly with the deivice is calle dthe function driver.
    - Filter Driver: Drivers that do auxiliary processing are called Filter drivers.

    - Some filter drivers observe and record information about I/O requests but don't actively take part in them. For example, some gilter drivers act as verifiers to make sure the other drivers in the stack handle the I/O request correctly.

  - We can refine our definition of a driver as any software component that observes or participates in the communication between the operating system and a device.
