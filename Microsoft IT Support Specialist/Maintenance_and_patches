- Types of Maintenance:

  - Corective maintenance: Is designed to prolong the lifespan of your devices and reduce the need for downtime. If an application ceases to funcion, then it is necessary to repair it. Forced repairs often cause many problems for a business such as bringin operations to a standstill without any warning. Forced repairs are not necessarliy planned for and are performed irregularly depending on a need arising. Companies are eager to avoid issues arising from their software. So, there are channels by which customers can report any issues. Ideally, a compnay finds and corrects an issues before it is reported. One initiative that companies make use of to avoid issues is to offer a reward for bug detection. The sum of the reward is then assessed based on the severity of the bug detected.
  - Routine maintenance: Performing routine or preventative maintenance involves taking hardware or software and examing it for any issues. This requires taking your device offline. In many cases, applying routine maintenance extends the life of a device Toutine maintenance is the process of managing the applications so that it is always up-to-date, secure, and bug-free
  - Predictive maintenance: The practise of applying maintenance due to a signal that failure is going to happen. Signals are determined by analyzing the signature patterns of devices and predicting failure points. It includes changing your software to adapt to new changes, like a new release of an operating system or other prominent technological changes.

- Maintenance tends to be distruptive to the normal operataions of a system. Applyng a patch or update simetimes requires functional systesm to be offline. Companies like Microsoft aim to deploy maintenance measures during geographically dark hours to minimize disruptions. Then, upgrades are deployed in batches so that is is easy to roll back to a previous version if any problesm occurs.
- Maintenance is implemented with a near-zero-downtime policy. This means that any disruptions to services are kept to a minimum. Once services are rolled out, companies aim to maintain a service level agreement of 99.999 uptime. Basically, great measures are being taken to ensure that any maintenance is non-disruptive.
