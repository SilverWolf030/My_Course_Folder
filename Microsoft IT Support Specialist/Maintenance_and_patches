- Types of Maintenance:

  - Corective maintenance: Is designed to prolong the lifespan of your devices and reduce the need for downtime. If an application ceases to funcion, then it is necessary to repair it. Forced repairs often cause many problems for a business such as bringin operations to a standstill without any warning. Forced repairs are not necessarliy planned for and are performed irregularly depending on a need arising. Companies are eager to avoid issues arising from their software. So, there are channels by which customers can report any issues. Ideally, a compnay finds and corrects an issues before it is reported. One initiative that companies make use of to avoid issues is to offer a reward for bug detection. The sum of the reward is then assessed based on the severity of the bug detected.
  - Routine maintenance: Performing routine or preventative maintenance involves taking hardware or software and examing it for any issues. This requires taking your device offline. In many cases, applying routine maintenance extends the life of a device Toutine maintenance is the process of managing the applications so that it is always up-to-date, secure, and bug-free
  - Predictive maintenance: The practise of applying maintenance due to a signal that failure is going to happen. Signals are determined by analyzing the signature patterns of devices and predicting failure points. It includes changing your software to adapt to new changes, like a new release of an operating system or other prominent technological changes.

- Maintenance tends to be distruptive to the normal operataions of a system. Applyng a patch or update simetimes requires functional systesm to be offline. Companies like Microsoft aim to deploy maintenance measures during geographically dark hours to minimize disruptions. Then, upgrades are deployed in batches so that is is easy to roll back to a previous version if any problesm occurs.
- Maintenance is implemented with a near-zero-downtime policy. This means that any disruptions to services are kept to a minimum. Once services are rolled out, companies aim to maintain a service level agreement of 99.999 uptime. Basically, great measures are being taken to ensure that any maintenance is non-disruptive.

- Optimizing Computer Performance:

  - Disk Fragmentation: Hard drives serve as the primary storage unit for a computer's data, programs, and operating systems. One of the critical aspects of optimizing your computer's performance is ensuring that the hard drive is clean and organized. Over time, your computer accumulates unnecessary files and data that can slow its operations. The disk cleanup method removes unnecessary files, such as temporary files, system logs, and unused applicastions. By regularly performing a disk cleanup, you can free up valuable disk space and improve the overall performance of your computer. Most operating systems have built-in disk cleanup tools to remove these unnecessary files effectively. For instance, Windows has the Disk Cleanup Utility, while MasOS has the Disk Utilty. Thes tools allow you to select the files you want to delete, such as temporary internet files, recycle bin contents, and system logs. Another essential techique is defragmentation. As you use your computer, files and data become fragemented and scattered across the hard drive. Fragmentation is where information becomes scatter across the hard drive due to normal day-to-day activites such as saving and deleting files. This fragmentation can lead to slower access times and decreased performance. Defragmentation rearranges fragmentaed files on a hard drive to consolidate them into contiguous blocks. This optimization enables quicker and more efficient access to data, ultimately enhacing overall system performance. It is a lot like sorting your files so that all related items are in the same cabinet instead of searching through several different ones to find what you are looking for.

  - Memory: Memory upgrades are crucial for optimizing your compuer's performance. The amount of memory, or RAM, in your compuer directly impacts its ability to handle multiple tacks simultaniously. When a compuer sills up the RAM, it stores additional information on the hard drive. Insufficient memory can lead to sluggish performance and frequent system crashes. By upgrading a computer's memory, you can provide the necessary resources to handle demanding applicastions and processes, resulting in improved performance and reponsiveness. As an IT professional, you must comprehensively understand the various programs and applications employees use and how they can be configured to run most effcientl. This will ensure they have a compuer that meets their needs.

  - Settings: Adjusting various settings on your computer con significantly impact its performance. For example, optimizing power settings can help conserve energy and improve laptop battery life; regularly powering down the laptop at the end of the day prolongs its efficacy and durability. Understanding and tweaking these settings allows you to tailor your computer's performance to meet your needs.

  - Maintenance: Ensuring your computer's security and smooth operating involves performing regular updates and patches for both your operating system and applications, running antivirus scans, and removing malware.
    Paying attention to the computer's start-up processes to optimize its performance is also beneficial. This can be completed by rewiewing the programs that automatically start when the computer initially runs. Then, disable any unnecessary programs. This will reduce startup times and improve the overall system responsiveness. A system that begins by starting too many unused programs will be sluggish.

  - General: Understanding the hardware-software relationship is crucial for comprehending system functionality and optimizing performance. The CPU is the computer's brain, reponsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. Memory, storage, and peripherals interact with the CPU to facilitate data processing and storage. You can identify potential bottlenecks and optimize their performance by understanding how these components work together. Ther operating systems plays a vital role in managing CPU processes and memory. It allowcates resources, schedules taks, and efficiently utilizes hardeare components. Understanding how the operating system interacts with the CPU and memory management is essential for optimizing performance. Additionally, device drivers act as intermediaries between hardeare devices and the operating system and play a crucial role in ensuring proper communication and funcionlality. By keeping device drivers up to date, you can enhance the performacnce and stability of your computer system.

- Vulnerability Management:

  - Network Testing: Identifying vulnerabilities is done by conducting what is known as a network scan. Network scanning involves pinging all devices on a network and identifying if some open ports or sevices can act as potenial gateways for cybercriminals to access.
    Potential vulnerabilities are listed and ranked coording to the threat level. Upon this, mitiaging actions are determined. It's important to note that an open port is not necessarily dangerous. Some ports are always open such as HTTPS, which allows you to connect and interact with the internet. To say a port is open means it listens for requests and then sends a response when pinged. Then, the system configuration and software that runs on that port are assessed and compared with known vulnerabilities. For example, WannaCry used port 445, which accepts data from the internet to inject some code to lock the users out of the system. Configuring a system might include closing this port to traffic ouside a company's firewall

  - Penetration Testing: Companies carry out penetration tests to test a system's security. A penetration test is a real-world simulated attack on your system. Microsoft's Assume Breach philosophy means they approach defense from the mindset that the hacker has already breached the system. This leads to the question of "What damage is possible once the cybercriminal is inside the system?".

  - Vulnerability Verification: Here, a security risk is ranked according to the Common Vulnerabilty Score System (CVSS). This is a standardized metric used to assess threat levels. However, with some systems, a combination of issues that arise tend to expose the network.
    While CVSS can indicate some dangers, the flow in a company's system may be the combination fo outdated software accociated with an open port and some other misonfigurations. Therfore, the IT professional assesses each incident on a case-by-case basis. Analysis tools can only give indications; they do not guarantee a system's security.

  - Treating Vulnerabilites: Having tested a system and compiled a list of ranked threas, the next step is to mitigate these issues. The ideal solutionis remediation. Remediation removes the threat to a system and is achieved by changing configurations or applying a particular patch. Failing this, a company may choose to mitigate the situation.
    Mitigation ses out to reduce the likelihood of exploitation or, in some other way, reduce the risk or fallout from a flaw
    A company can also choose acceptance. This approach means that the company has identified as a possible weakness or flaw. However, they leave the issue unresolved. This might be done because the fix is too large, or the damage that might be done is not large enough to warrant taking time to fix it.
