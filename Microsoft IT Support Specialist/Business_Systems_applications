- This encompasses all areas associated with running the business, from managing payroll to compiling and presenting customer analytics. In this reading, you'll becaome familiar with the considerations that go into selecting suitable software.
- Considerations for choosing business software:
  - Business Size: How many people in you company would use the software? Would this be affected by the staff size changing over time?
  - Business Needs: Are there funcions that the business cannot currently perform, or would like to do more effectively or efficiently?
  - Task that can be Automated: Are there tasks that the business completes manually which could be done by software instead?
- Software Types:
  - Accouting Software: for recording and managing financial transactions.
  - Billing Software: for handling invoices and payments.
  - Database Software: for creating and maintaining databases.
  - Payroll Software: for calculating and administering payments to employees.
  - Analytics Software: for presenting data in ways that produce new insights.
- Microsoft Dynamics:

  - Microsoft Customer Relationship Management (CRM) combines popular standalone applications, such as Word and Excel, and more advanced applications such as Power Bi, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. A business whishing to manage its need could use Dynamics CRM to organize its marketing, sales, and services that could be selted include that following:

  - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing: This easy-to-use business application providesa a graphical interface for plotting the customer journey. A customer journey is a real-time marketing tool that monitors customer behavior and enables push notificats, alers and updates to direct a customer to engage with a product. This service includes customizable emails and text messages that can be automated to execite after a specific trigger condition is met. The success of each approach can be recored to generate analytics on how best to engage your customers.

  - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales: An adaptive sales system that actively monitors sales signals. It uses AI and machine learning to generate sales initiatives from everydat workflows. This application allows you to iport Excel worksheets that ocntain your sales data. Form this, the applicastion can perform sales analysis and identify trends.

  - Microsoft Dynamcis 365 Customer Service: This is a knowledge management center. It retains customer and agent experiences to provide company-wide-knowledge-based for interactions witha company's customers.

  - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service: This servie helps a company's field agents by providing the required tools for mobile workers. The application provides tools for creating work orders, achedules, inventory, and billing. It enables a working document and updates all services provide from onsite.

  - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operation: This is a project delivery tools that aims to connect sales, staffing, resources, project managment, and finance teams. It assists project managers by providing work-breakdown structures, resources scheduling, and progress-tracking tools such as Gannt Charts.

- Dealing with Limitations:

  - Software: Software limitations refer to the internal constaints imposed by the software, which can affect system performance. One common issue is the presence of resource-heavy applications. These applications require segnificant system resources, such as CPU processing power, memory, or storage. Multiple resource-heavy applicastions running simultaneously can strain the system, resulting in slower performance and decreased user experience.

  - Compatibility: Compatibility problemn are a significast challenge due to software limitations. Incompatibility between software components or with hardware can cause system instability and reduced functionality. For instance, conflicts between software and the operating system or hardware often lead to crashes or launch failures.
    These issues hinder user efficieny, impacting company productivity. Thorough testing during development and utilizing compatibility layers can help mitigate these challenges Ensuring compatibiliy among all software and hardware components minimizes disruptions and enhances operational efficiency.

  - Inefficiencies: Software inefficiencies can also impact system performance. Inefficient software algorithms or coding practices can result in slower execition times and increased resource consumption. A poorly optimized software program may take longer to perform a specific task, requiring more CPU cycles and memory resources. This inefficiency can lead to decreased system responsiveness and overall performance.

  - Mitigating Strategies: To effectively address these software limitations, it's essential to optimize software settings, entailing the configuration of software to maximize the efficient utilization of system resources. For example, adjusting graphical sttings in a video game can reduce the strain on the GPU and improve overall performance. Similarly, tweaking resource-heavy application settings to limit resource usage can help prevent system slowdowns. Updating or replacing outdated softwre is another strategy to overcome software limitations. Software developers often release updates to address bugs, improve performance, and enhace compatibility. By regularly updating software, users can benefit from these improvenments and ensure that their systesm are running the latest versions with the most up-to-date features and optimizations. In some cases, outdated software may need to be replaced if it is no longer supported or compatible withthe current hardware or operating system. Aligning software choices with available hardware resources is essential for managing software limitations effectively. When selecting software applications, it is crucial to consider the hardware specifications and capabilities. As discussed, runing resource-heavy software on a low-end compuer with limited processing power and memory can lead to signigicant performance issues. Users can ensure a smoother and more efficient computing experience by choosing software optimized for the available hardware resources. Balancing company resources may involve knowing which computer to allocate to which employee.

- Cloud solution for hardware limitations:

  - Cloud Solutions: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These modesl enable users to access advanced computing power, storage, and applicastions without significant hardware investments.

  - IaaS: A cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It allows users to rent virtual machines, storage, and networks on demand. IaaS enables uses to scale their computing resources up or down based on their needs without needing physical hardware upgrades. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for organizations with fluctuating workloads. Infrastrucure relates to the physical machines on which the software programs run. Renting IaaS means that instead of purchasing several high-spec computes, a company can rent IT infrastructrue for as long as required. An example would include Microsoft Azure, an online solution providing the client with Azure virtual machines running applicastions, Azure Blob storage for storing large amounts of unstructured data, and Azure Virtual Network for linking different resources.
