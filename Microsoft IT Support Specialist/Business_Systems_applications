By regularly updating software, users can benefit from these improvenments and ensure that their systesm are running the latest versions with the most up-to-date features and optimizations. In some cases, outdated software may need to be replaced if it is no longer supported or compatible withthe current hardware or operating system. Aligning software choices with available hardware resources is essential for managing software limitations effectively. When selecting software applications, it is crucial to consider the hardware specifications and capabilities. As discussed, runing resource-heavy software on a low-end compuer with limited processing power and memory can lead to signigicant performance issues. Users can ensure a smoother and more efficient computing experience by choosing software optimized for the available hardware resources. Balancing company resources may involve knowing which computer to allocate to which employee.

- Cloud solution for hardware limitations:

  - Cloud Solutions: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These modesl enable users to access advanced computing power, storage, and applicastions without significant hardware investments.

  - IaaS: A cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It allows users to rent virtual machines, storage, and networks on demand. IaaS enables uses to scale their computing resources up or down based on their needs without needing physical hardware upgrades. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for organizations with fluctuating workloads. Infrastrucure relates to the physical machines on which the software programs run. Renting IaaS means that instead of purchasing several high-spec computes, a company can rent IT infrastructrue for as long as required. An example would include Microsoft Azure, an online solution providing the client with Azure virtual machines running applicastions, Azure Blob storage for storing large amounts of unstructured data, and Azure Virtual Network for linking different resources.

  - PaaS: Offers a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications. It provides a complete development environment, including operating systems, programming languages, and developmet tools, An example of PaaS would be Microsoft's Azure PaaS service, which offers developers benefits including:
    - Faster Development Cycles: Azure's pre-configured environments and development tools expedite the develpment process, leading to quicker application deployment.
    - Applications logic focus: With Azure managing the infrastructure, developers an concentrate on crafting their applications' core functionalities and user experience.
  - An example of an Azure PaaS Service would be Azure App Service. This service provides hosting for web applications developed in different programming languages. Developers can concentrate on their code without the need to be concerned about server setup and maintenance.

  - SaaS: A cloud computing model that delivers software applications online. Users can access these applicastions through a web browser, eliminating the nned for installation and maintenance on their local mahcines, SaaS applications are typically hosted and managed by the cloud service provider, relieving users of the hardware and software management burden. Client relationship management (CRM) systems, productivity applications, and collaboration platforms use this approach extensively.
    -Software as a Service (SaaS) on Azure allows you to utilize applications directly over the internet through a web brower. This eliminates the need to local installactions and ongoing maintenance on individual devices.
    -Azure SaaS empowers user by allowing:
    - On-Demand access: Access essential applicasiton from any device with an internet connection, fostering flexibility and remote work capabilities.
    - Reduced IT Burden: Azure manages the software infrstructure, freeing you from software updates, patching, and hardware maintenance.
  - An example of Azure SaaS is Dynamics 365. This is a comprehensive customer relationship management (CRM) solution, Dynamics 365 helps mangage customer interactions and streamline sales processes. With Azure SaaS, you can access this powerful CRM tool from anywhere.

  - Advantages:

    - Scalability: Traditional hardware-based solutions often require significant upfront investments to accommodate peak workloads. However, with cloud computing, users can quickly scale their resources up or down based on demand. This elasticlity allows organizations to optimize resource utilixation and avoid overprovisioning, resulting in cost savings. Consider the vendor that sells concert tickets. During off-peak times, there might be a minimal demand for resources, However, close to the big concerts, they may experience a massive surge in onlince traffic. A company that only rents the computng power to manage this during these few peak hours will benefit from maximizing resource usage.It is interesting how companies can rent only the computing power they need during peak times to reduce costs and avoid scquiring specialized software for limited periods. This way, they can maintain their standard traffic at a minimal cost and still be able to cater to high-demand times.

    - Availability and Reliability: Another benefit of cloud computing is its ability to provide high availablitiy and reliability. Cloud service providers typically operate multiple data centers across different geographical locations. This redundancy ensures that even if one data center fails, the services remain accessible from other places. Additionally, cloud providers employ advanced data replication and backup strategies to protect against data loss. These measures enhance the reliablilty and availability of applications and data. You will often hear the mantra 99.9999% uptime. Using the cloud is one wy to achieve this end. Security Cloud computing also offers improved security compared to traditional hardware-based solutions. Cloud service providers invest heavily in security measures, including physical security, network security, and data encryption. They emply dedicated security teams to monitor and respond to potential threats. Additionally, cloud providers often comply with industry standards and regulations, ensuring that data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy requirements. Due to their large subscriber base, cloud providers can hire top cybersecurity experts to protect against cyber threat. This collective effort surpasses the security budget of individual companies.

  - Drawbacks:
    - Internet connectibity reliance: Cloud computing's dependence on internet access may be a cause for concern. Since cloud services are accessed online, a steady and dependable internet connection is neccessary.
    - Costs: Another concern is higher daily overheads. Adopting cloud computing eliminates the need for company hardware but is offset by higher daily operaional expenses for running diverse services. If the cloud servic decides to raise prices, daily operations could become less profitable for a business.
    - Vender lock-in: There is a concern about vendor lock-in when a company's infrastructure is provided solely by one vendor. The company may wish to use other services, but their infrastructure is incompatible. Equally, a company may find it difficult to switch vendors as their infrastructure is too heavily reliant on the current provider.
