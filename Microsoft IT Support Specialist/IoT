- Internet of Things (IoT):

  - The internet of things refers to connected devices that don't always need direct human input and can communicate amongst themselves and the cloud. This is possible because of technological advances in computer chips that have made them smaller, less expensive, and better able to deal with power demands. Computer chips like this can act as amll sensors collecting data, forming part of a much bigger product. For example, you may have a sensor in your fridge, and with network connectivity, it can communicate with an app that reports the fridge's capacity. The sensor could report on the contents of your fridge, and the data could help you decide which items to buy or not to buy to reduce food waste.
