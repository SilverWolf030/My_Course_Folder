- Reserved and Commonly Allocated Ports:

  - Port Number Ranges:

    - Well-known Ports: (0-1,023) are reserved for specific protocols and services used by system processes and applications.

    - Registered Ports: (1,024-49,151) are assigned by IANA for specific services or protocols and can also be used by user applications.

    - Dynamic or Private Ports: (49,152-65,535) are used by client applications to connect to servers and are assigned temporarily for the duration of a session.

  - Well-known Ports#:

    - Well-known port numbers are reserved for some of the most commonly used and popular protocols in computer network. These ports can either transfer verified dat via TCP or unverified data via UDP. They are assigned at the transport layer of the OSI model or TCP/IP suite and identified at the application layer.

    - When using protocol port numbers, the destination port is usually specified as the initial step in requesting the correct service from the device that provides the service. If a server can support multiple protocols, the destination prot must specify which protocol it wants to use.

    - To improve the security of data being transmitted over networks, many protocols now have alternative versions. These alternative version often involve encryption using a security protocol to enhance security. One such example is HTTPS, which uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to encrypt data as it moves across the network. TLS is also in other protocols to improve their security, with the letter 'S' added to the end of the original protocol name to signify the use of TLS.

  - Registered Port#:

    - Registered ports are assigned by IANA to companies for specific service that they want to use. These ports are often used in the gaming sector to identify the ports that need to be opened in home networks to allow games to function.

    - Examples include prot 3074 for the XBOX live network or port 3,479 for the Playstation network. These ports have changed as games become less relevant and new ones emerge on the market. As technology changes, new ports are assigned and old ones are retired. Some registered ports have been around for a while, such as SIP and H323 which are video conferencing protocols that use port numbers 1,719, 1,720, 5,060, and 5,061. For SIP, prot 5,060 is used for unencrypted data, while prot 5,061 is used for encrypted data.

  - Dynamic or Private Port#:

    - Dynamic or Private ports are essential for communication between protocols using TCP or UDP. When a computer has multiple web pages open simultaneously, dynamic ports are used to identify different sessions. Each open web page will be associated with a different port number, which serves as the source port number for communication between devices. This is crucial because it allows your computer to determine which data belongs to which web page, and it is also the number used for devices to communicate responses.

- Ports in Use Case Study:

  - Identifying protocols and sessions on a Windows device

  - To find the current sessions and protocols in use on a Windows machine, you can use the command prompt. As you may recall, you used the command prompt earlier to find your IP address. This application is available in most Windows operating systems and is commonly used to troubleshoot or solve certain kinds of Windows issues.

    - Here's how to open the command prompt and get your current sessions and protocols:

      - Click on the Windows Start button in the taskbar, typically located at the bottom of your screen.

      - Type cmd in the search bar and click on the thumbnail for the command prompt app.

      - An app with a black background will load. Type netstat -a in the black space and press enter.

      - Wait for 30 seconds to view the sessions that are currently in use.

      - Identify one of the sessions by noting the ports and protocols in use.

    - The netstat command commonly displays http or https as protocols when executed. Other protocols will display, depending on the applications currently running on the system.

    - HTTPS displayed as protocol after entering netstat-a command

  - Identifying protocols and sessions on a Mac

  - To find the current sessions and protocols on a Mac machine, you need to launch the Terminal app. You might recall from an earlier example that the Terminal app is a command line interface (CLI) for the operating system (OS) used by Macs. Network administrators typically use the Terminal app to initiate an action that is not supported by the operating system's graphical user interface (GUI).

    - Here's how to open the Terminal app and get your current sessions and protocols:

      - Open the Terminal app using Spotlight search or find it via Go > Utilities.

      - A window with a white background will load. Type netstat -a in the white space.

      - A Mac device can produce a lot of output, so scroll back to where you typed the netstat command, and directly beneath this you will have your sessions.

      - Identify one of the sessions by noting the ports and protocols in use.

- Common ports

  - Common or well-known ports are a range of port numbers (0 to 1023) that are assigned to commonly used Internet services and protocols. These ports are standardized and widely recognized across various operating systems and networks. Some examples of well-known ports include the following.
    HTTP (port 80)

  - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) port 80 is the default port used for accessing websites and web servers. When you enter a URL in your web browser, it establishes a connection with the web server on port 80 and retrieves the requested web page or content.
    HTTPS (port 443)

  - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) port 443 is used for secure communication over the Internet. It employs encryption to protect data transmission, making it ideal for sensitive transactions such as online banking, e-commerce, and other secured services.
    FTP (port 21)

  - The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) port 21 is used for transferring files between computers over a network. FTP clients establish connections with FTP servers on this port to upload, download, or manage files and directories.

21 : File Transfer Protocol (FTP) control

22 : Secure Shell (SSH) for secure remote access

23 : Telnet for unencrypted remote access

25 : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email transmission

53 : Domain Name System (DNS) for domain name resolution

80 : Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for unencrypted web browsing

110 : Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) for email retrieval

143 : Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) for email retrieval

443 : Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) for encrypted web browsing

There are some other ports that are often used by some common applications that are not in this range of 0-1023. Here is a list of those ports.

3306 : MySQL database server

3389 : Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for remote desktop access

5900 : Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for remote desktop sharing

8080 : Alternative port for HTTP web servers

- Registered ports

  - Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and are assigned to specific applications or services by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Proprietary software, gaming applications, and various other services commonly use these ports.

  - Unlike well-known ports, which are standardized and used by widely recognized internet protocols and services, registered ports are allocated to specific organizations or software vendors. This allocation process helps prevent conflicts and ensures that different applications or services can coexist without interfering with each other's network communications.

  - Commercial software applications, multimedia streaming services, online games, and other proprietary solutions often use registered ports. For example, many popular online games use registered ports for data transfer, voice chat, and other in-game communications. Similarly, video conferencing applications, remote desktop software, and file-sharing utilities frequently utilize registered ports to facilitate their respective functionalities.

- Dynamic or private ports

  - Dynamic or private ports range in number from 49152 to 65535. These ports are typically used for temporary or ephemeral connections and are not officially assigned to any specific application or service. Ephemeral connections refer to temporary or short-lived connections between devices or systems.

  - Unlike well-known and registered ports, which are reserved for specific purposes, dynamic or private ports are used for short-lived connections initiated by client applications. When a client application needs to connect with a server, it randomly selects an available port from the dynamic or private port range to serve as the source port for the outgoing connection.

  - This approach helps ensure that multiple client applications running on the same system can establish connections simultaneously without conflicting with each other's port usage. Once the connection is terminated, the dynamic or private port is released and can be reused by other applications.
