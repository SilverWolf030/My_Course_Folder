- Preventing a attacker from gaining entry to a system:
  - Gateway security is the top recommendation for cybersecurtiy. The reason is simple: if you can prevent any external unauthorzed entity from accessing your system, you can ensure that your assets are procteced. As with personal computers, the devices for accomplishing this are known as firewalls. A firewall will sit between a trusted network and filter traffic coming from an untrusted one.
  - With on-premisis access, implementing a firewall is relatively straightforward; all traffic coming from the internet is outside traffic and is treated with severe restrictions. All inside traffic is authorized and subject to more relaxed contraints. This is somewhat more complicated for cloud-based businesses, as the resources accessing the cloud resources may be dispersed. This means that it is more difficult to ameka clear distincition between the inside and outside of a network.
- Segregation to limit damage upon access
  - If a threat is able to breach a gateway, there is another safeguard that can be implemented:
  - Segregation access is an effective security measure that can be applied to both traditional and cloud-based businesses. There are several ways that this can be achieved, the shared idea is that access to one area only gives you a pass to some parts of a business, not all of it. These cloud-based solutions are implemented to deal with the vulnerabilities created by people accessing company resources using different types of devices in different and changing locations.
  - Zero Standing Access is the overarching concept that access to the production environment must be kept to a minimum and cannot be persisted over time. This means you must validate that you are authroized whenever you wish to access production-related areas. Even then, your access will only allow you to make changes sufficient to the area you have been authorized to access. Two critical policies that have grown from this are:
    - Just-In-Time (JIT)
    - Just-Enough-Access(JEA)
      - JIT means that having accessed a given area;you will only retain your access for a limited period of time before you are automatically ejected or asked to re-enter some authorization code.
      - JEA relates to the limitations on the changes you can make while there.
      - As a security specialist configures which areas should be accessed by which individuals, as well as what privileges are required when a specialized task needs to be engaged very carefullu. Giving the wrong individual inappropriate access can be the difference between a minor and a severe security breach.
  - Recovery:

    - In this regard, cloud-based businesses have an advantage over traditional ones because creating back-ups and spinning up new environments is part of cloud computing.
    - In a traditional approach, applications are run on hardware, and it is advised to save and back up information regularly, Recall that this can be done by following the 3-2-1 recovery plan, which involves keeping three copies of everything in 2 formats, and 1 copy off-site.
    - In operating on the cloud, cloud-based businesses already have their workflow virtualized. In addtion, the underlying architecture ensures that backups are created of everything that goes online. This ensures that if there is a issue with accessing a business's resources, the hosting company can provide an alternative. Finally, it is good practive employed by cloud providers to store information in different geoplogical locations.
