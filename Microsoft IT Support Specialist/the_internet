- The internet revolutionized commuication and technology worldwide, but do you know why it was created in the first place back in 1969? Even though there were only a handful of computers around then, it's mainly for the same reason we need it now: to connect computers so information can be passed between machines. This need expanded as more and more computers needed ot communicate, leading to the creation of the world wide web in 1989 by Sir Timothy Berners-Lee. Im 1990, only 0.5 percent of the world was connected online, compared to 2022, when nearly 65 percent of the world was connected by the internet.

- For the internet's fast rate of growth to be possible, a couple of things were needed: language, standards, and protocols. Sir Berners-Lee, who created the world wed web, also developed an easy-to-use language know as hypertext markup language, better known as HTML. This language makes it very easy to exchange and display information, and it's the language behind all the webpages you use even today. Of course, network commmunication on both a small and a large scale require standards and protocols to enable communication, hence the birth of IP and IP addresses which you've already learned about.

- Internet Service Providers (ISPs):

  - The internet is vast, and no single person, business, or country owns it. It has become something that everyone can use despite their location because there are so many connected networks. but how do those networks connected to one another? This is where internet service providers, or ISPs, play a role.

  - An ISP is similar to a global mail delivery network, but it moves data around instead of mail. Like delivery services, different IPSs rely on partners in other areas of the world to deliver information to recipient' homes. Because IPSs are all interconnected, they can pass each others' data across their own infrastructure.

  - IPSs allow you to get online and connect in a few different ways:

    - Broadband: Provided either through fiber cables or phone lines. It's a high-speed internet connection that is widely used today.

    - Wireless Connection: Wifi and mobile service providers fall under this category. With this kind of connections, internet connectivity is made up of radio waves, and the internet can be connected anywhere, irrspective of the location, as long as it's in range.

      - Wifi: Wireless fidelty or Wifi allows high-speed internet connectivity without the use of wires.

      - Mobiles Phones: Mobiles phones are now equipped with an option for internet connectivity via a contract.

      - Satellite: Where broadband connections are unavailable, satellites are used for wireless internet connectivity.

      - DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): DSL is a type of wireless internet connection that uses copper wires to transmit data.

  - For many of these connections, you need a device from the service provider to connect the technology to your home. This device could be a router, a modem, or, in the case of a mobile phone, a sim card.

  - There are hundreds of IPSs that are all interconnected across the world, allowing everyone to communicate across the connections that they've setup.

  - As the internet grows, so doe the need for more IPSs to help connect everyone and provde all the connections worldwide. IPSs are esponsible for running cables to out homes and across the world.
