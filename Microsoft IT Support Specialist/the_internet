- The internet revolutionized commuication and technology worldwide, but do you know why it was created in the first place back in 1969? Even though there were only a handful of computers around then, it's mainly for the same reason we need it now: to connect computers so information can be passed between machines. This need expanded as more and more computers needed ot communicate, leading to the creation of the world wide web in 1989 by Sir Timothy Berners-Lee. Im 1990, only 0.5 percent of the world was connected online, compared to 2022, when nearly 65 percent of the world was connected by the internet.

- For the internet's fast rate of growth to be possible, a couple of things were needed: language, standards, and protocols. Sir Berners-Lee, who created the world wed web, also developed an easy-to-use language know as hypertext markup language, better known as HTML. This language makes it very easy to exchange and display information, and it's the language behind all the webpages you use even today. Of course, network commmunication on both a small and a large scale require standards and protocols to enable communication, hence the birth of IP and IP addresses which you've already learned about.
