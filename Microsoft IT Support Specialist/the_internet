- The internet revolutionized commuication and technology worldwide, but do you know why it was created in the first place back in 1969? Even though there were only a handful of computers around then, it's mainly for the same reason we need it now: to connect computers so information can be passed between machines. This need expanded as more and more computers needed ot communicate, leading to the creation of the world wide web in 1989 by Sir Timothy Berners-Lee. Im 1990, only 0.5 percent of the world was connected online, compared to 2022, when nearly 65 percent of the world was connected by the internet.
