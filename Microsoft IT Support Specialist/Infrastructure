- On-Premises Versus Cloud Services:

  - On-Premises infrastructure, also referred to as the private cloud, are cloud computing environments that are for the use of only one organization. On-Premises infrastructure can provide the same type of services as public clouds while offering greater control and security. This kind of infrastructure resides within a company's datacenters. If the company needs to protect sensitive data and if everyone works at the office, an internet connection may not be needed because all the employees are connected through the private cloud. If the company doesn't have sensitive data and not everyone wants to or can work from the office, the on-premises infrastructure must provide an internet connection.

  - In both public and private cloud models, you know that the applications or services are running on server hardware. This can be owned and placed on-premises in other words, a private cloud or rented from a public cloud provider. If you have offices and buildings you will always need to provide some infrastructure on the premises, whether you use a private or public cloud. This is because employees will need access to the network. Thus, the need for switches, routers, and wireless connectivity still exists no matter what cloud option you choose.
