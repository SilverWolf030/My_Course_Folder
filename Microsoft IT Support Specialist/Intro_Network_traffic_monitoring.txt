- Network Traffic Monitoring:

  - Monitoring can be split into two main tasks: network monitoring and network traffic monitoring. On the one hand, network 
  monitoring involves keeping track of network devices for availability and faults. In contrast, network traffic monitoring is 
  monitoring what protocols and data are moving around a network and monitoring for performance and security threats.

  - Monitoring Bandwidth:

    - Bandwidth is an important concept when it comes to network traffic monitoring and performance. It's a term you might be 
    familiar with because when you look for an internet provider, you generally want the fastest connection you can afford,
     meaning bandwidth is your first priority. That's because it determine the rate at which data moves across a network. 
     This is not usually a problem if only a few people and applications use a network. But things can get pretty busy, and 
     some applications are more demanding than others. Just take video conferencing as an example; it takes up a lot more bandwidth 
     than just visiting a web page. Bandwidth is much like the road in the illustration below: you can only a accommodate a certain 
     number of cars before the road becomes blocked. That's why monitoring what is using a lot of bandwidth is critical.

  - Monitoring Users:

    - When monitoring your network, you also want to track users to check what applications they use and what their regular 
    day-to-day activity is. Doing this can create an audit trail, but more importantly, it reveals patterns so you can better 
    understand the network traffic behavior on a day-to-day basis. Knowing how your network behaves makes it easier to spot when
     something isn't quite right. This is very similar to a security guard keeping an eye on a shop and identifying suspicious 
     customers based on what they've learned from the out-of-the-ordinary behavior of customers who previously stole from the shop.
      On a network, you can also look for out-fo-place activity. For example, you notice a new application for the first time or 
      that something specific uses a lot more bandwidth that usual. This could be a security problem, maybe there's an attack
       generating traffic, or perhaps it's simply something new that needs more bandwidth, and the network has to adjust to accommodate it.

  - Network Traffic Monitoring Steps:

    - Choose your data source and protocols:

      - To monitor network traffic, you need to determine the best source. This monitoring can be split into two categories: 
      packet capture and flow analysis.

      - Packet Capturing:

        - This is a way of collecting copies of packets that are moving around a network. You can decide to do this at 
        different points across the network using a computers to run the packet capture software and a mirrored port.
        A mirrored port is created to copy and data that runs through it to your computer port and the connected packet 
        capturing software. An application called Wireshark has traditionally been the go-to choice for performing this activity.

      - Flow Analysis:

        - Flow analysis is supported on many network devices and is typically a built-in feature. Two protocols that an do this are called
        Netflow and Sflow. Netflow is a Cisco proprietary protocol that runs on Cisco routers and switches. SFlow was developed to work on many
        platforms. Netflow collects IP traffic only, but SFlow can collect and analyze data from layers 2 to 7 of the OSI model. They type of 
        analysis does not copy data from one port to another, so it's very flexible as the data can be collected centrally.

    - Selecting the correct component:

      - Devices on the network that can support traffic monitoring include servers, switches, routes, and firewalls.
      You can even monitor specific interfaces and their applications as well as devices. However, you don't want to capture everything happening
      everywhere on your network, as this will generate a lot of data to analyze. You need to pick key areas of the network that oversee communication.

      - Packet capturing will only be used when troubleshooting particular problems in a specific area because it's restricted to the area you are plugged into.
      Flow analysis does not capture whole data packets like packet capturing. Instead it captures packet details like ports and IP address. In other words, 
      just the information needed to understand data from many different devices at the same time.

    - Using Monitoring tools:

      - When a network grows, so does the amount of data flow that you will need to analyze, and this is when you need third-party software that can collect all the
      flow traffic. There are many different traffic monitoring tools out there that are very capable of analyzing flows and putting the data into an easy-to-read format.
      They usually also include tools for alerting a network manager of problems or anomalies on the network.
