- Why is file encryption necessary?

- File encryption is essential for securing sensitive information stored on a device or transmitted over a network. This includes personal, financial, or medical data. Without encryption, anyone accessing the device or intercepting the ata can easily read, copy, or alter. This can lead to identity theft, fraud, blackmail, or other serious consequences.

- File encryption is especially important in scenarios where the device or data is at risk of being lost, stolen, or compromises, such as:

  - Traveling with a laptop, tablet, or smartphone that contains confidential or personal data.

  - Using a public or shared computer or network to access or send sensitive data.

  - Storing or backing up data on an external hard drive, USB flash drive, or cloud service.

  - Disposing of or selling an old device that has not been wiped clean of data.

- The inner working of encryption: Making data unreadable:

- At its core, encryption utilizes complex algorithms to transform data into an unreadable format. This process involves replacing the original data with a seemingly randomized sequence of characters. This makes it impossible to decipher without the corresponding decryption key.

- The strength of encryption is directly linked to the encryption algorithm's complexity and the decryption key's length. Popular encryption tools, like Bitlocker and FileVault, employ the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The AES is considered a gold standard in data security, with a key length of 256 bits. This combination provides virtually unbreakable protection for your files.

- Why encryption matters:

- Encryption serves as a critical defense mechanism, safeguarding your sensitive information from unauthorized access in various scenarios like the following.

  - Lost or stolen devices: Encryption acts as a powerful deterrent if your laptop, phone, or external storage device is lost or stolen. Even if the device falls into the wrong hands, the encrypted data remains inaccessible without the decryption key. This reduces the risk of data breaches and identity theft.
