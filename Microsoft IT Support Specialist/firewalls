- Firewall Types:

- Initially, the first kind of firewall was just a packet-filtering firewall. In other words,a device that simply checks where a packet has come from, where it's going, and what type of protocol it has. And based on that information, the packet-filtering firewall determines if the packet should be allowed entry or denied. But attacks can be hidden in the data in packets, inside that payload itself so firewalls have had to evolve to check inside packets too. This evolution has led to the development of different firewall types that can perform specific functions.

  - Packet Filtering Firewalls: inspects each data packet as it travels through a network. They decide whether to block a specific packet based on the configured rules.

  - Application-layer firewalls: can be a physical appliance using its own hardware or software-based installed on another machine, like plug-in or a filter. These types of firewalls target applications and monitor their behavior. for example, if placed in front of a web server, they can inspects requests for HTTP connections and block abnormal floods of traffic indicating a DoS Attack.

  - Circuit-Level Firewalls: checks whether TCP and UDP connections across a network are valid before data is exchanged. For example, this type of firewall might first check whether the source and destination addresses, the user , the time, and the data meet certain defined rules. Data is exchanged between parties without further investigation when these checks pass, and a session starts.

  - Proxy server firewall: controls the information that goes in and out of a network. This ability mains the server can monitor, filter, and cache data requests to and from a network. Firewall proxy servers provide sage and secure internet access to all devices on a network.

  - Stateful firewall: Inspects connections on a network. As traffic hits the firewall, it monitors all packets that go through it and stores a combination of information about the packets in a state table. The state table tracks sessions by recording port numbers as sessions start from inside the network and are transmitted outside of the network. Gathering this information helps the firewall recognize what legitimate traffic with the correct prot numbers should look like upon its return, thus allowing legitimate replies back into the network.

  - Next-generation firewall: performs may of the same functions as a stateful firewalls but with more functions from other types of firewalls, such as packet filtering and VPN support. This type of firewall also investigates packets more thoroughly compared to stateful firewalls. For example, a next-generation firewall can examine the payload for each packet and inspect it for suspicious characteristics and malware.

- Firewall Rules:

- A firewall is configured with many different rules, and together they create a firewall policy. The rules are per interface and direction. this is also dependent on the interface that is involved. A network interface can refer to any kind of software to any kind of networking hardware. For instance, if you have two printers on your network you can control the interface for them independently. A printer could have an incoming interface and an outgoing interface and have different rules for each.

- Wherever the firewall is places, the rules making up the policy determine that is and isn't allowed in out of a network.

  - Source Address: where the data has come from. This is typically an IP address burt can also be a fully qualified domain name or FQDN. An FQDN is the name of a device on the internet, verified by an external DNS server.

  - Destination Address: where the data is going. This is usually an IP address but can also be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

  - Port and Protocol numbers: the services that applications require.

  - The interface: rules can be associated with particular interface or port on a firewall.

  - Directions: whether the traffic is inbound or outbound.

  - Time: specify when the dat will or won't be permitted.

  - The Decision: whether to permit or deny the packet.

- When creating firewall protocols, it's important to remember the following three rules:

  - Top-Down Processing: a firewall starts at the top of a policy list, making its way down to the bottom, so the order of the rules is critical.

  - Rule matched: if any incoming traffic matches the criteria or a firewall rule, the firewall will apply the specified allow or deny action without proceeding to the next rule. Any of the other rules below the matched rule will not be considered because firewalls implements top-down processing.

  - Implicit Deny: also known as deny all. This is typically an invisible rule applied when a firewall is initially set up, and it blocks all traffic from the start. It enables a firewall to protect the network as soon as it's activated. This rule remains active the whole time, so many firewall policies have permit statements (also known as allow statements) to allow necessary traffic through. Implicit deny is always the last rule on the rules list. And because it's active by default and invisible, it's important to remember it's there.

  - Even though it's invisible and usually there by default, it's best practice always to check that the implicit deny rule is active so your website is protected. The implicit deny rule specifies the whole IP suite, not just existing protocols that make up the IP suite, like TCP and UDP. This educes the number of rules you need to create because now you don't need two separate rules; one for TCP and another for UDP. But with only the implicit deny rule in place, no traffic will be allowed, so another rule has to be created.
