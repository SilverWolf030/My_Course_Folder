- Operating System: (OS) is a term for software that oversees the interation between hardware and
  software operations and provides a means through which a human can interact with the system.
  Systems will have different needs and funcionalities, so there are several variations of operating systems
  that can run the applications.

- Types of Operating System:

  - Batch Operating System
  - Time-sharing Operating System
  - Distributed Operating System
  - Networks Operating System
  - Real-Time Operating System

  - Batch Operating System (BOS)
  - A BOS allows multiple users to work in tandem by compartmentalizing each user's action sand only allowing
    one user control at any given time. Users connont communicate with one another and when the task is completed,
    control is passed to the next user. The advantage of this approach is that is allows many users to work on large
    projects at the same time.
