- Machine learing in action:

  - A field focused on training machines throught speialized data processing techniques. Machines learning plays an important role in the evolution of medicine, agriculture, and other fields.

  - what "behavios" are made possible through machines learing? Some of the more common broad capabilities include the following:

    - Anomaly Detection: The capability to automatically detect errors or unusualy acttivity in a system.

    - Computer Vision: The capabiity of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.

    - Natural language processing: The capability of a computer to interpret written or spoken language and respond in kind.

    - Knowledge mining: The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

  - How does Machine Learing work?

    - Remember that data can come in many forms. It can be numbers, text, images, sounds, videos, or sensor outputs. All of these items can be converted into numbers. The conversion process for an image is different than that of a written text. Each has been developed by experts in their field, however, once the process has been applied, then one can use the same algorithm to detect a topic in a conversation, an object from an image, or fraudulent behavior in an online transaction. Before this can happen, the model first has to be trained using data.

    - For example, let's say you would like to train a model to distinguish betwen images of taxis, and vehicles that are not taxis. You might approach this by giving the model labeled instances of each. Given enough instance, the model can then classify the image when shown a new instance.

    - Another application of computer vision in object detection. Every photograph is a representation of an image using pixels. Machine learing algorithms can learn to identify a concentration of these pixels and determine where the boundary line is. When applied to an image of a busy street, a well-trained model can discern individual vehicles, people, and more.

    - Another useful capability is anomaly detection, which invovles training a machine to recognize elements that are outside the norm. These often indicate that something is wrong and can trigger an action or alert as a response. This is not limited to visual elements, as machines ca also detect notable differences in numbers, timing, and more. For example, consider how this approach is used in F1 auto racing; detailed machine learing modesl are applied that analyze sensor readings from different parts of the vehicle, such as the engine, brakes, suspension, aerodynamics, and more.

    - These sensors outputs are gathered, processed, and fed into a machine-learning model. The model also is given labels such as whether the car breaks down, is dipping below average speeds, os is achieving peak performance. These indicators that deviate from the standard readings are referred to as anomalies.

  - Machine Learing in Cypbersecurity:
    - A representation of your daily activities is contructed. Wehn processing images, these data points could be represented by pixels. In this instance, the same algorithm can instead take in differet data point, such as:
      - the frequenty of activity
      - The location from where a transaction was executed
      - The amounts spent
      - The types of purchases made
    - A flag is raised when the activity deviated from normal activiy. You can think about this in terms of a conversation. Imagine you are discussing a topic with someone, and suddenly they indtroduce words and ideas that don't follow the natural flow of the conversation and go against your expectaations. In much the same way as preteding the performance of the race car, machine learning models can detect these anomalies.
    - When a flag is raised, it can trigger another action such as sending an alert notification or activating an authentication app that needs to be cleared before the ction is sanctioned. The training data for thee models are buile on previous transactions and labeled "standard" and fraudulent instances. First, the algorithm will identify anomalous activity or activity that deviates from the standard pattern. This then can be used to apply further checks to determine if fraudulent behavior is occurring. Additionally, this methodology can be applied to detect patterns of attack. Company logs following a hack can be reviewed for any identifying patterns of activity that will indicate that an attack is in progress, or about to happen. These are called signature patterns.
